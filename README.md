# HelvetiSteps

HelvetiSteps is a beautifully minimal app designed to give you only the information you need concerning your burned calories and effort during a single day window. The app provides a trend graph that shows spikes of activity over the course of the twenty four hour period, and also shows averaged data for your heart rate entries.
If you're bored of the interface provided by Apple, and looking for a lean modern look, then this is the HealthKit app for you!

Coming soon: I'll bee adding some more HealthKit items to the app as well as GameCenter support.
